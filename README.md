Hello there coders,

My name's Daniel and I'm a 32 year old philosopher who started coding in BASIC when I was 8 in a Spectrum 128k but gave it up for over two decades to pursue other goals, such as mastering Shakespearean insults. I am now ready to come back and check out what's happened in the meantime.
